/*
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Break down the question => 
    need an array (one is given) 
    The output is the sum of the numbers in the array added to each other (1+ 0 = 1, 1+2 = 3, 1+2+3 = 6) 
    so you start by adding just the one number, then the first and second
    then the first second and third etc

    you need a variable to store the value of the sum (total)
    you need a variable to store the results, in this case an array [results]
    then you need to push the total to the new array(.push)
